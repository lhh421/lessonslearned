Here are a few of the ways that Managers can instill good project management practices among his / her team.

Efficient communication system between Developers and Management
- Recommend usage of up-to-date version control platform
- Employ the "Kanban" system
  - Visible layout of tasks in "To-Do" / "On-Hold" / "WIP" / "Completed" buckets to allow accountability, resource management, etc.
  
Provide environment for Developers to get things done, efficiently
- Allow flexibility in Developer work hours as long as work gets done and does not impact other parties involved (Results Only Work Environment or ROWE rather than stressing unnecessary face time)
- No weekly update meetings at 10am, do not interrupt Programmer's solid chunk of work time
  
Provide environment to foster Developers career growth
- Delegate often and make sure Developers feel a sense of ownership towards his / her projects
- Be supportive of Developers' participation in meet ups, forums, etc.
- If requested, give opportunities to rotate around multiple roles
- Act more as a director rather than a micromanager
